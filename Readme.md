
Build World Soccer Player Database

1. Create local postgres fifa_db database
2. db_create.sql for table creation (players, player_skill, player_perf)
3. fbref_scraper_v4.ipynb reads fifa20 player data from players_20.csv and loads players and player_skill.  Also scrapes fbref.com for Premier League squad data to load player_perf table.
